<h1>Data Structure - Graph Data Structure</h1>

<hr/>



<hr/>
<p>A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as <b>vertices</b>, and the links that connect the vertices are called <b>edges</b>.</p>
<p>Formally, a graph is a pair of sets <b>(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> is the set of vertices and <b>E</b> is the set of edges, connecting the pairs of vertices. Take a look at the following graph −</p>

<p>In the above graph,</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">V = {a, b, c, d, e}</p>
<p style="padding-left:8%;">E = {ab, ac, bd, cd, de}</p>
<h2>Graph Data Structure</h2>
<p>Mathematical graphs can be represented in data structure. We can represent a graph using an array of vertices and a two-dimensional array of edges. Before we proceed further, let's familiarize ourselves with some important terms −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Vertex</b> − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. In the following example, the labeled circle represents vertices. Thus, A to G are vertices. We can represent them using an array as shown in the following image. Here A can be identified by index 0. B can be identified using index 1 and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Edge</b> − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. In the following example, the lines from A to B, B to C, and so on represents edges. We can use a two-dimensional array to represent an array as shown in the following image. Here AB can be represented as 1 at row 0, column 1, BC as 1 at row 1, column 2 and so on, keeping other combinations as 0.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Adjacency</b> − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge. In the following example, B is adjacent to A, C is adjacent to B, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Path</b> − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. In the following example, ABCD represents a path from A to D.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Following are basic primary operations of a Graph −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Add Vertex</b> − Adds a vertex to the graph.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Add Edge</b> − Adds an edge between the two vertices of the graph.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Display Vertex</b> − Displays a vertex of the graph.</p></li>
</ul>

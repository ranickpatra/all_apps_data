<h1>Data Structures - Divide and Conquer</h1>

<hr/>



<hr/>
<p>In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem.</p>
<img alt="Divide and Conquer" src="./../images/divide_and_conquer.jpg"/>
<p>Broadly, we can understand <b>divide-and-conquer</b> approach in a three-step process.</p>
<h2>Divide/Break</h2>
<p>This step involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. Sub-problems should represent a part of the original problem. This step generally takes a recursive approach to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. At this stage, sub-problems become atomic in nature but still represent some part of the actual problem.</p>
<h2>Conquer/Solve</h2>
<p>This step receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. Generally, at this level, the problems are considered 'solved' on their own.</p>
<h2>Merge/Combine</h2>
<p>When the smaller sub-problems are solved, this stage recursively combines them until they formulate a solution of the original problem. This algorithmic approach works recursively and conquer &amp; merge steps works so close that they appear as one.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following computer algorithms are based on <b>divide-and-conquer</b> programming approach âˆ’</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Merge Sort</li>
<li>Quick Sort</li>
<li>Binary Search</li>
<li>Strassen's Matrix Multiplication</li>
<li>Closest pair (points)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various ways available to solve any computer problem, but the mentioned are a good example of divide and conquer approach.</p>

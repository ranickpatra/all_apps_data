<h1>Data Structures - Dynamic Programming</h1>

<hr/>



<hr/>
<p>Dynamic programming approach is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently. Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used. Mostly, these algorithms are used for optimization. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub-problems. The solutions of sub-problems are combined in order to achieve the best solution.</p>
<p>So we can say that −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problem.</p></li>
<li><p>An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic algorithms use memorization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>In contrast to greedy algorithms, where local optimization is addressed, dynamic algorithms are motivated for an overall optimization of the problem.</p>
<p>In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, where solutions are combined to achieve an overall solution, dynamic algorithms use the output of a smaller sub-problem and then try to optimize a bigger sub-problem. Dynamic algorithms use memorization to remember the output of already solved sub-problems.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following computer problems can be solved using dynamic programming approach −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Fibonacci number series</li>
<li>Knapsack problem</li>
<li>Tower of Hanoi</li>
<li>All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall</li>
<li>Shortest path by Dijkstra</li>
<li>Project scheduling</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic programming can be used in both top-down and bottom-up manner. And of course, most of the times, referring to the previous solution output is cheaper than recomputing in terms of CPU cycles.</p>

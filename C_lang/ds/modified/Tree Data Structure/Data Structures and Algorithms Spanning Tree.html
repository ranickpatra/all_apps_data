<h1>Data Structure &amp; Algorithms - Spanning Tree</h1>

<hr/>



<hr/>
<p>A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..</p>
<p>By this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least one spanning tree. A disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree, as it cannot be spanned to all its vertices.</p>
<img alt="Spanning Trees" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranickpatra/all_apps_data/master/C_lang/ds/modified/images//spanning_trees.jpg"/>
<p>We found three spanning trees off one complete graph. A complete undirected graph can have maximum <b>n<sup>n-2</sup></b> number of spanning trees, where <b>n</b> is the number of nodes. In the above addressed example, <b>n is 3,</b> hence <b>3<sup>3−2</sup> = 3</b> spanning trees are possible.</p>
<h2>General Properties of Spanning Tree</h2>
<p>We now understand that one graph can have more than one spanning tree. Following are a few properties of the spanning tree connected to graph G −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A connected graph G can have more than one spanning tree.</p></li>
<li><p>All possible spanning trees of graph G, have the same number of edges and vertices.</p></li>
<li><p>The spanning tree does not have any cycle (loops).</p></li>
<li><p>Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected, i.e. the spanning tree is <b>minimally connected</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a circuit or loop, i.e. the spanning tree is <b>maximally acyclic</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mathematical Properties of Spanning Tree</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Spanning tree has <b>n-1</b> edges, where <b>n</b> is the number of nodes (vertices).</p></li>
<li><p>From a complete graph, by removing maximum <b>e - n + 1</b> edges, we can construct a spanning tree.</p></li>
<li><p>A complete graph can have maximum <b>n<sup>n-2</sup></b> number of spanning trees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we can conclude that spanning trees are a subset of connected Graph G and disconnected graphs do not have spanning tree.</p>
<h2>Application of Spanning Tree</h2>
<p>Spanning tree is basically used to find a minimum path to connect all nodes in a graph. Common application of spanning trees are −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Civil Network Planning</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Computer Network Routing Protocol</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Cluster Analysis</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us understand this through a small example. Consider, city network as a huge graph and now plans to deploy telephone lines in such a way that in minimum lines we can connect to all city nodes. This is where the spanning tree comes into picture.</p>
<h2>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h2>
<p>In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other spanning trees of the same graph. In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance, congestion, traffic load or any arbitrary value denoted to the edges.</p>
<h2>Minimum Spanning-Tree Algorithm</h2>
<p>We shall learn about two most important spanning tree algorithms here −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/kruskals_spanning_tree_algorithm.htm">Kruskal's Algorithm</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/prims_spanning_tree_algorithm.htm">Prim's Algorithm</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both are greedy algorithms.</p>
